/*
In this example, we write a C++ program that reads a data file consisting of each
student’s GPA followed by the student’s name. The program then prints the highest GPA and
the names of all of the students who received that GPA. The program
scans the input file only once. Moreover, we assume that there is a maximum of
100 students in the class.s

INPUT:
GPA NAME
3.4 Bob
4.0 Silva
3.5 Kilua
2.2 Gon
1.5 Goku
4.0 Picollo
4.0 Bulma



OUTPUT:
The highest GPA and all of the names associated with the highest GPA.
